This template repository is the starter project for Programming 2 Lab 12. Written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### Question(s)

Pick two of problems of your choice that we haven't solved previously and write JUnit tests for them.

### Solutions
Q1) Added a class, and test cases for a class called CatAndMouse that determines the outcome of which cat gets the mouse first based on the position of the Cats and the mouse, if both cat gets to the mouse at the same time, the mouse wins.
